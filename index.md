# Dennis Triepke Data Science Portfolio

This is a collection of some of my Data Science projects for learning and growing.  

## [Text-based Graph Convolutional Network with tensorflow 1.x](https://github.com/dtriepke/Graph_Convolutional_Network)
- Created the GCN model from the paper  [Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05679.pdf)  
- Trained and tested the model with IMDB movie review sentiment classification dataset in a Semi-Supervised approach

## [NLU Model Selection App](https://github.com/dtriepke/nlp_model_selection_app)
NLU has created a powerful API for embeddings (and even some NLP downstream-task like sarcasm detection or sentiment classification) in 1-liner of code. However, at the beginning of each NLP projects, you are facing the issue of selecting the model that fits best to your data structure. This app is designed for selecting and comparing pre-trained NLP models from NLU (John Snow Lab) with own data. Whether your project has word, sentence or document embeddings: upload the data, select some pre-trained models and download the embeddings. 

- Model Selection Word Embedding  
- Model Selection Sentence or Document Embedding
- Fake News Classifier
