# Dennis Triepke Data Science Portfolio

This is a collection of some of my Data Science projects for learning and growing.  

## Text-based Graph Convolutional Network with tensorflow 1.x
- Created the GCN model from the paper  [Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05679.pdf)  
- Trained and tested the model with IMDB movie review sentiment classification dataset in a Semi-Supervised approach
